# Basic Shopping

"Basic Shopping" is a small, powerful and easy to use shopping cart solution. It provides all the functionality and user interfaces needed for user registration, login, profile update, product rating, adding / removing from shopping cart, payment with user's available credit / balance and presentation of user's past orders.
Basic Shopping was built by Pure PHP on the backend or server side. No external PHP frameworks or PHP libraries were used to build this small yet powerful web application. It was implemented based on MVC design pattern and implements some basic coding features like autoloading and routing. Therefore, it is highly extensible and maintainable.
