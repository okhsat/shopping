# Basic Shopping

Basic Shopping is a small, powerful, and easy to use shopping cart solution. It provides all the functionalities and user interfaces required for user registration, login, profile updating, product rating, adding to/removing from the shopping cart, payment by user's available credit/balance, and presentation of user's past orders.

Basic Shopping has been created by Pure PHP in its backend or server-side. No external PHP framework or PHP library has been used for creating this small but at the same time very powerful web application.

The demo of this application is accessible at http://www.turandevelop.com .
